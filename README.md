# skiller-UX-UI
Using Pencil Project (an open source UI, UX and prototype tool for Windows), I created a screenflow and a prototype of what Skiller was supposed to be, based on the perspectives of a low-end user, i.e. the volunteer.

Go into 'volunteer' folder, and click on index.html, after downloading the files. You can also see the screen flow as a PowerPoint file.
